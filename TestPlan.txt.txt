TESTING PLAN
Project: Corporate Weekly Report Generator

OBJECTIVE:
Ensure the Prototype Pattern correctly clones objects without modifying the original template.

TEST CASE 1: Verify Cloning Capability
- Action: Request a report with ID "1" from the Registry.
- Expected Result: The system returns a Report object that is NOT null.
- Status: Pass

TEST CASE 2: Verify Data Independence
- Action: 
    1. Clone Report A from Registry.
    2. Change the content of Report A.
    3. Clone Report B from Registry.
- Expected Result: Report B should still have the original "Template" content, not the changes made to Report A.
- Status: Pass

TEST CASE 3: Performance (Optional)
- Action: Measure time to Clone vs Time to Create New Object.
- Expected Result: Cloning is faster for complex objects.
